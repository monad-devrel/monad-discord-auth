# ⚡️ Welcome to the Monad Discord Auth Contributing Guide ⚡️

Hey, awesome builder! We're thrilled that you're here and ready to contribute to Monad Discord Auth. Whether you're squashing bugs, adding epic new features, or making our docs shine, your contributions are what power this project forward. Let's create something extraordinary together!

## About the Project

**Monad Discord Auth** is your minimalist toolkit for integrating Discord authentication into Next.js apps. It’s built to be lightweight yet powerful, giving you the flexibility to create and innovate without boundaries.

Need a quick overview? Check out the [README](README.md) to get started.

### 🚧 Project Status

We’re always pushing forward, and Monad Discord Auth is in active development. Peek into our open Issues, track what’s happening, and jump in where your skills can shine!

## Getting Started

There are endless ways to contribute:

- 🔧 Tackle open issues
- 🐞 Report bugs or suggest new features
- 📖 Enhance our documentation

Contributions come to life through Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Here’s how to keep things smooth:

- 🔍 Check for existing Issues and PRs before creating a new one.
- 🎯 Focus on one change per PR—either functionality or style, but not both.
- 📝 If you hit a snag, give us the context. Let us know what you were doing and how to recreate the issue.
- ✨ Stick to the project’s coding style. Use our prettier/linting configs to keep things consistent.

### Issues

Issues are the heart of our project. They’re where you can report bugs, suggest new features, or brainstorm improvements.

#### ⚙️ Solve an Issue

Browse our [existing issues](https://github.com/monad-devrel/monad-discord-auth/issues) and pick one that excites you. If no one’s working on it, claim it and start building!

#### 📝 Create a New Issue

If you don’t see your concern listed, feel free to create a new issue. Here’s how to make it effective:

- Provide as much context as possible.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue or reasons for the feature request.
- Screenshots, videos, and other visuals are always a plus!

### Pull Requests

#### 🚀 Pull Request Process

We follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr):

1. 🍴 **Fork the repo**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top-right of the GitHub page. This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

2. 👯 **Clone your fork locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/monad-discord-auth.git
   cd monad-discord-auth
   ```
3. 🌱 **Create a new branch**:

   Name it something descriptive of the changes you’re making. This helps keep things organized and makes it easier for others to understand the purpose of your branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

4. 💻 **Make your changes**:

   Now that you’ve got your branch set up, it’s time to dive into the code! Whether you’re fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or refining documentation, this is where the magic happens.

   - **Bug Fixes**: Get to the root of the issue, squash the bug, and test it thoroughly to make sure it's gone for good.
   - **New Features**: Build with the big picture in mind—keep it smooth, intuitive, and well-documented for the next dev.
   - **Docs**: Keep it clear, concise, and user-friendly. If it helps, add examples to make things crystal clear.

   Don’t forget to write or update tests to cover your changes. This helps maintain the integrity of the project and ensures that future updates won’t unintentionally break your contributions.

5. 💾 **Commit your changes**:

   Writing a good commit message is essential for maintaining a clean and understandable project history.

   Here’s a quick guide to crafting a solid commit message:

   - **Start with a short summary** (50 characters or less) that describes what the commit does.
   - **Optionally, add a longer description** on a new line to explain why the changes were made or to provide additional context.
   - **Reference any related issues** if applicable (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

   Example of a concise commit message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix OAuth token refresh bug"
   ```

6. 📤 **Push your branch**:

   After committing your changes, the next step is to push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub. This makes your work available for review and potential merging into the main project.

   Push your branch with the following command:

   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

   Once your branch is pushed, GitHub will generate a link to help you quickly open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch. This link will be displayed in your terminal or available directly in your repository's GitHub page.

7. 🔄 **Open a Pull Request**:

   Now it’s time to open a Pull Request (PR) and share your work with the Monad community! This is where your changes will be reviewed, discussed, and ultimately merged.

   To create a PR:

   1. **Go to your forked repository on GitHub.**
   2. **Click on the “Compare & pull request” button**, which should appear right after you push your branch. If it doesn’t, navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click on "New pull request."
   3. **Fill out the PR form:**

      - **Title**: Keep it short and to the point (e.g., `Add logging to OAuth`).
      - **Description**: Explain what your PR does, why it matters, and add any helpful details—bullet points, screenshots, or code snippets work great.
      - **Link Issues**: If your PR fixes an issue, mention it (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

   Before submitting, review your PR to ensure everything is clear and complete. When you’re ready, click the "Create Pull Request" button to submit your PR for review.

8. 🛠️ **Address feedback**:

   After submitting your PR, Monad maintainers will review it. They might suggest tweaks, request changes, or ask questions. This feedback keeps the project sharp and on track.

   - **Respond to feedback**: Address comments, make changes in your branch, and push updates.
   - **Push updates**: Your PR will auto-update with new commits.
   - **Stay engaged**: Participate in discussions, clarify points, and mark conversations as resolved once done.

9. 🔗 **Merge your changes**:

   After your PR has been reviewed and approved, it’s time to merge your changes into the main branch. Typically, the project maintainers will handle this step using the “squash-and-merge” strategy, which combines all your commits into a single commit. This approach keeps the commit history clean and easy to follow.

   If you’re a maintainer with merge privileges:

   1. **Click the "Squash and merge" button** on the PR page.
   2. **Confirm the merge** with a final commit message summarizing the changes.
   3. **Delete the branch** if it’s no longer needed.
